## GROUP A: Define Objective and Collect Data (Steps 1–2)

### Objective
Understand the problem and explore the dataset structure.

### Key Deliverables
- **Problem Definition**: Predict house sale prices based on 79 features
- **Dataset Analysis**: 1,460 training samples with 80 columns
- **Feature Identification**: 79 input features + 1 target variable (SalePrice)

### Files
- `GROUP_A_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive analysis and findings
- `data_analysis.py` - Python script for data exploration

### How to Run
```bash
cd Group_A_Define_Objective_Collect_Data
python data_analysis.py
```

### Key Findings
- **Target Variable**: SalePrice ($34,900 - $755,000)
- **Features**: Mix of numerical (LotArea, YearBuilt, etc.) and categorical (Neighborhood, HouseStyle, etc.)
- **Problem Type**: Supervised Learning - Regression
- **Data Quality**: Well-structured with some missing values

---

## GROUP B: Prepare Data and Select Algorithm (Steps 3–4)

### Objective
Clean data and select appropriate ML algorithm.

### Key Deliverables
- **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features
- **Normalization**: Scale features to standard range
- **Algorithm Selection**: Sequential Neural Network with 3 hidden layers
- **Model Configuration**: Adam optimizer, MSE loss, MAE metrics

### Files
- `GROUP_B_REPORT.md` - Detailed explanation of data preparation
- `data_preparation.py` - Python implementation

### How to Run
```bash
cd Group_B_Prepare_Data_Select_Algorithm
python data_preparation.py
```

### Key Concepts
- **Normalization**: Scales features to 0-1 range for better training
- **Encoding**: Converts categorical variables to numerical format
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Model Architecture**: Input → Dense(64) → Dense(32) → Dense(16) → Output

---

## GROUP C: Train and Test Models (Steps 5–6)

### Objective
Train models and evaluate performance using interactive frameworks.

### Key Deliverables
- **Model Training**: Train neural network on prepared data
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with layers, learning rates, activation functions
- **Performance Evaluation**: Monitor loss and accuracy metrics
- **Transfer Learning**: Demonstrate using pre-trained models

### Files
- `GROUP_C_REPORT.md` - Detailed training methodology
- `model_training.py` - Python implementation

### How to Run
```bash
cd Group_C_Train_Test_Models
python model_training.py
```

### Key Experiments
1. **Effect of Hidden Layers**: More layers = better pattern learning
2. **Learning Rate Impact**: Balances convergence speed and stability
3. **Activation Functions**: ReLU vs Tanh for different scenarios
4. **Noise Handling**: Models must generalize despite real-world noise

### Training Dynamics
- **Epoch 1**: Loss = 500,000,000 (high error)
- **Epoch 50**: Loss = 30,000,000 (significant improvement)
- **Epoch 100**: Loss = 15,000,000 (convergence)
- **Total Improvement**: ~97% reduction

## GROUP D: Predict and Visualize Results (Steps 7–8)

### Objective
Visualize results and extract business insights.

### Key Deliverables
- **Visualization 1**: Average prices by neighborhood (Column Chart)
- **Visualization 2**: House style distribution (Pie Chart)
- **Visualization 3**: Price vs living area (Scatter Plot)
- **Visualization 4**: Price trends over time (Line Chart)
- **Interactive Filters**: Neighborhood, price range, quality rating

### Files
- `GROUP_D_REPORT.md` - Detailed visualization analysis
- `visualization_analysis.py` - Python implementation

### How to Run
```bash
cd Group_D_Predict_Visualize_Results
python visualization_analysis.py
```

### Key Insights
1. **Location Impact**: Premium neighborhoods command 3-4x higher prices
2. **Size Matters**: Strong correlation between living area and price
3. **Quality Premium**: Higher quality ratings significantly increase price
4. **Age Factor**: Newer homes command premium prices
5. **Market Segmentation**: Budget (30%), Mid-range (50%), Premium (20%)
