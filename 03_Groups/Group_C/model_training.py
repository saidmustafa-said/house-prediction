print("""
What Happens During Training:

Step 1: Forward Pass
  - Input data flows through network
  - Each layer applies weights and activation
  - Output layer produces prediction

Step 2: Calculate Loss
  - Compare prediction with actual value
  - MSE = (1/n) × Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
  - Quantifies prediction error

Step 3: Backward Pass (Backpropagation)
  - Calculate gradient of loss with respect to weights
  - Determine how much each weight contributed to error

Step 4: Update Weights
  - Adjust weights using optimizer (Adam)
  - Move in direction that reduces loss
  - Learning rate controls step size

Step 5: Repeat
  - Process next batch of data
  - Continue until epoch complete
  - Repeat for multiple epochs

Loss Progression Example:
  Epoch 1:   Loss = 500,000,000 (random initialization)
  Epoch 10:  Loss = 100,000,000 (learning patterns)
  Epoch 50:  Loss = 30,000,000  (significant improvement)
  Epoch 100: Loss = 15,000,000  (convergence)
  
  Improvement: ~97% reduction in loss!

print("-" * 80)
print("""
Underfitting:
  - Model too simple to learn patterns
  - High training loss
  - High test loss
  - Poor performance on both sets
  - Solution: Add more layers/neurons, train longer

Optimal Fit:
  - Model learns patterns well
  - Low training loss
  - Low test loss
  - Good generalization
  - Goal: Achieve this state

Overfitting:
  - Model memorizes training data
  - Very low training loss
  - High test loss
  - Poor performance on new data
  - Solution: Reduce complexity, add regularization, early stopping

Monitoring Strategy:
  - Track both training and validation loss
  - Stop when validation loss stops improving
  - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting

print("-" * 80)
print("""
Key Hyperparameters:

1. Number of Layers
   - More layers: Better for complex patterns
   - Fewer layers: Faster training, less overfitting
   - Typical: 2-5 layers for most problems

2. Number of Neurons
   - More neurons: More capacity to learn
   - Fewer neurons: Faster training, less overfitting
   - Typical: 64-256 neurons per layer

3. Learning Rate
   - Too low: Slow convergence
   - Too high: Unstable training
   - Typical: 0.001 - 0.01

4. Batch Size
   - Smaller: More frequent updates, noisier
   - Larger: Fewer updates, smoother
   - Typical: 16-64

5. Activation Functions
   - ReLU: Fast, good for hidden layers
   - Tanh: Smoother, good for some problems
   - Linear: For output layer in regression

6. Regularization
   - L1/L2: Penalizes large weights
   - Dropout: Randomly disables neurons
   - Early Stopping: Stops when validation loss plateaus

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Formula: (1/n) × Σ|y_actual - y_predicted|
   - Units: Dollars
   - Easier to interpret than MSE
   - Average prediction error

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Formula: √MSE

   - Penalizes large errors

4. R² Score
   - Range: 0 to 1

print("\n7. TRANSFER LEARNING (TEACHABLE MACHINE)")
print("-" * 80)
print("""
What is Transfer Learning?
  - Use pre-trained model as starting point
  - Fine-tune on new task
  - Faster training with less data
  - Better performance than training from scratch

Teachable Machine Example:
  1. Loaded pre-trained MobileNet model
  2. Removed final classification layer
  3. Added new layer for "High Price" vs "Low Price"
  4. Trained only new layer on collected images
  5. Achieved 95% accuracy with 30 images

Benefits:
  ✓ Faster training (minutes vs hours)
  ✓ Requires less data (30 vs 1000+ images)
  ✓ Better accuracy (95% vs ~70% from scratch)
  ✓ Leverages knowledge from ImageNet

When to Use:
  - Limited training data
  - Similar problem to pre-trained model
  - Need fast results
  - Have computational constraints
